# FungeletV2, a Befunge IDE built as if its a real language!
## Tech stack
Fungelet is a static webapp. It is built upon:
1. **Typescript** for the bulk of the logic, with JsDoc.
2. **jinja2-cli** for modular html through jinja.
3. **Sass** for modular CSS stylesheets

To run this project, you'll need to have Jinja2 installed,
as well as npm. Then invoke `npm i`.

Afterward, do `npm run build` to build the project.
